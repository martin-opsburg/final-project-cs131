### ToDo
  7 #   0.  Write up better comments for each function
  8 #   1.  Add some user.input.validation
  9 #   2.  Wrap most of it up into a loop that
 10 #           ends when user_digits == correct_digits is True
 11 #           or 10 fatal attempts at guessing correct_digits
 12 #   3.  Put some polish on it
 13 #       [] remove unused functions
 14 #       [] exception handling
 15 #       [] improve the greeting print.format
 16 #       [] review function names to make sure they make sense
